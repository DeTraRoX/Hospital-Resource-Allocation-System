üåü Project Overview

In a fast-paced healthcare environment, efficient resource management is a life-saving necessity. The Hospital Resource Allocation System is a powerful full-stack solution designed to streamline hospital operations. It provides a real-time, dynamic dashboard for administrators to monitor resource availability, manage patient waiting lists, and track system activities with unparalleled ease. This application helps optimize decision-making and ensures that critical resources are allocated to patients who need them most.



‚ú® Key Features

Real-time Resource Dashboard: A clean and intuitive dashboard that provides a live view of vital resource availability, including beds, ICU units, ventilators, and oxygen cylinders. The data updates instantly via WebSockets, eliminating the need for manual refreshes.



Automated Patient Queue: Patients are automatically registered and placed on a waiting list. The system intelligently allocates resources to the next available patient, ensuring a fair and streamlined process.



Live Activity & Allocation Logs: A dynamic log feed provides a continuous stream of events as they occur, such as new patient registrations and resource allocations. This transparent logging ensures that administrators can track every action within the system.



Robust & Scalable Backend: Built on FastAPI, a high-performance Python web framework, the backend is asynchronous and robust, capable of handling multiple concurrent requests. It includes a WebSocket server for real-time communication.



Intuitive & Responsive Frontend: Developed using modern HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, the user interface is simple to navigate and responsive on all devices, providing a seamless user experience.



Dynamic Database Management: Utilizes SQLModel for a smooth, type-safe interaction with the database and Alembic for managing database migrations, ensuring the schema remains consistent as the project evolves.
